## _American sign language (ASL) to text conversion using CNN_
We propose an innovative ASL recognition chat application that addresses the significant communication barrier between ASL users and the hearing community. Using deep learning techniques, our system utilizes live video input from webcams to detect and interpret ASL gestures, converting them into text or voice output for improved understanding and communication. By leveraging YOLOv5 for efficient hand gesture detection and DenseNet with transfer learning for robust ASL recognition, our solution achieves superior performance with limited training data. Through the creation of the "ASL-DS" dataset and evaluation using experiment hyperparameters, our application promotes inclusive communication, social inclusion, and equal opportunities for all individuals, fostering effective and accessible communication between ASL users and the hearingÂ population.
